# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree

The program is comprised of 5 courses and 5 projects. 

## 1. Neural Networks: [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](1%20Predicting%20Bike-Sharing%20Patterns)
I Learned neural networks basics, and built my network with Python and NumPy. I've defined and trained a multi-layer neural network, and used it to analyze real data. In this project, I built and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bike-share users on a given day.

## 2. Convolutional Neural Networks: [Dog Breed Classifier](2%20Dog%20Breed%20Classifier)
In this project, I defined a Convolutional Neural Network that performs better than the average human when given the task: identifying dog breeds. 
Given an image of a dog, my algorithm produces an estimate of the dog’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code *also* produces an estimate of the closest resembling dog breed. Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I made design decisions
about the user experience for my app.

## 3. Recurrent Neural Networks: [Generate TV Scripts](3%20Generate%20TV%20Scripts)
In this project, I built my own Recurrent Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks with PyTorch. I performed sentiment analysis and generate new text, and used recurrent networks to generate new text that resembles a training set of TV scripts.

## 4. Generative Adversarial Networks: [enerate Faces](4%20Generate%20Faces)
I Learned Generative Adversarial Networks with the model’s inventor, Ian Goodfellow. Then, apply what I've learned in this project and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN. This DCGAN is made of a pair of multi-layer neural networks that compete against each other until one learns to generate realistic images of faces.

## 5. Deploying a Model: [Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model](5%20Deploying%20a%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Model/Project)
In this project, I trained and deployed my own PyTorch sentiment analysis model using Amazon SageMaker on AWS. This model was trained to do sentiment analysis on movie reviews (positive or negative reviews). I built the model, deployed it, and created a gateway for accessing this model from a website.
